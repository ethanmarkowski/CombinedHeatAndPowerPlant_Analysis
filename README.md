# CombinedHeatAndPowerPlant_Analysis

The MEMS 1051 - Applied Thermodynamics course culminated with students working in small groups to design and optimize a combined heat and power plant design. For this project, we compared the performance of two different Non-Ideal Rankine cycles, one that utlilzed reheat and another that featured an open feedwater heater. 

This repository contains the EES code that we wrote to compete a thermal analysis of each system and optimize key design parameters.
